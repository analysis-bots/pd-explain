        case the value set in the global configuration is used (which defaults to True).
        :param sample_size: All explainers. The number of samples to use when use_sampling is True. Can be either an integer or a float.
        If it is an integer, that number of samples will be used. If it is a float, it will be interpreted as a percentage

        If you wish to explain the groups of a groupby operation, leave this parameter as None while calling explain on the
        groupy result. The labels will be automatically extracted from the groupby operation.
        :param coverage_threshold: Many to one explainer. Minimum coverage threshold. Coverage is
        defined as the % of the data in the group that is explained by the explanation. Defaults to 0.7.
        :param max_explanation_length: Many to one explainer. Maximum explanation length permitted. Defaults to 3.
        :param separation_threshold: Many to one explainer. Maximum separation threshold. Separation error is defined as the

        :param p_value: Many to one explainer. A scaling factor for the maximum number of attributes that will be considered
        as candidates for the explanation. n_attr = max_explanation_length * p_value. Setting this to a higher value may
        result in a more accurate explanation, but will also increase the computation time. Defaults to 1.
        :param explanation_form: Many to one explainer. The form of the explanation. Can be either 'conj' or 'disj', for
        conjunction and disjunction respectively. Defaults to 'conj'.
        :param prune_if_too_many_labels: Many to one explainer. If True, the labels will be pruned if there are too many
        labels to consider. Defaults to True.
        :param max_labels: Many to one explainer. The maximum number of labels permitted. Above this number, the labels
        will be pruned if prune_if_too_many_labels is True. Defaults to 10.
        :param pruning_method: Many to one explainer. The method to use when selecting which labels to prune. Cab be
        'largest' - where the k labels with the most values are kept, 'smallest', 'random', 'max_dist' - where the k labels
        with the highest distance between their means * group size are kept, 'min_dist', 'max_silhouette' - where the k groups with the
        highest silhouette score * group size are kept, or 'min_silhouette'. Defaults to 'largest'.

        the specified number of bins. Defaults to False.
        :param num_bins: Many to one explainer. The number of bins to use when binning numeric labels. Defaults to 10.
        :param binning_method: The method to use when binning numeric labels. Can be either 'quantile' or 'uniform'.
        :param label_name: Many to one explainer. How to call the labels column in the explanation, if binning was used
        and the labels column did not have a name. Defaults to 'label'.
        :param explain_errors: Many to one explainer. Whether or not to explain where the separation error originates from
        for each explanation. Defaults to True.
        :param error_explanation_threshold: Many to one explainer. The threshold for how much a group needs to contribute
        to the separation error to be included in the explanation. Groups that contribute less than this threshold will
        be aggregated into a single group. Defaults to 0.05.
        :param add_llm_explanation_reasoning: All explainers. Enables using a LLM to generate additional context explanations, explaining why
        the explanations found occur. Defaults to False. Requires setting an API key. See the documentation for more information.
        Note that setting this to True will increase the computation time by a potentially large amount, entirely dependent on the LLM API response time.
        Also note that the output of the LLM is not guaranteed to be accurate, and may contain errors, so use with caution.
        :param debug_mode: Developer option. Disables multiprocessing and enables debug prints. Defaults to False.
        :param min_commonness: MetaInsight explainer. Patterns must encompass at-least this percentage of the values to
        be considered a common pattern. Defaults to 0.5.
        :param no_exception_penalty_weight: MetaInsight explainer. The weight given to the penalty in the case no exceptions
        are found to a common pattern. Defaults to 0.1. Higher values will give more priority to common patterns with exceptions.
        :param balance_factor: MetaInsight explainer. The weight given to exceptions when computing the score of a common pattern.
        Defaults to 1 - same ratio for both common patterns and exceptions. Higher values will give more priority to common patterns without exceptions.
        :param filter_columns: MetaInsight explainer. The columns to filter on when mining for common patterns.
        :param max_filter_columns: MetaInsight explainer. The maximum number of filter columns to use when automatically
        selecting the filter columns. Defaults to 3.
        :param aggregations: MetaInsight explainer. The aggregations to use when mining for common patterns.
        :param max_aggregation_columns: MetaInsight explainer. The maximum number of aggregation columns to use when automatically
        selecting the aggregation columns. Defaults to 3.
        :param groupby_columns: MetaInsight explainer. The columns to group by when mining for common patterns. If not provided,
        will be inferred automatically from the filter / aggregation columns.
        :correlation_aggregation_method: MetaInsight explainer. When auto-selecting groupby / filter / aggregation columns,
        a correlation based method is used to determine the best method to use. This parameter determines which aggregation
        function is used to aggregate the computed correlation in the case of multiple columns. Can be either 'avg', 'max' or 'sum'.
        :param allow_multiple_aggregations: MetaInsight explainer. Whether or not to allow multiple aggregations to be used
        in the same pattern. Defaults to False. May result in more complex and less interpretable patterns if set to True.
        :param allow_multiple_groupbys: MetaInsight explainer. Whether or not to allow multiple groupbys to be used in the same pattern.
        Defaults to False. May result in more complex and less interpretable patterns, possibly with multiple
        (almost or completely) disjoint indexes if set to True.
        :param use_all_groupby_combinations:MetaInsight explainer. When automatically inferring on a result of a groupby operation, whether to
        use all combinations of the groupby columns or just the provided ones. For example, if set to True and the groupby columns are ['A', 'B'],
        the groupby columns will be [['A'], ['B'], ['A', 'B']]. If set to False, only the provided groupby columns will be used.
        :param do_not_visualize: If True, the explanation will not be visualized (if the explainer supports disabling visualization).
        :param display_mode: Fedex explainer and MetaInsight explainer. How to visualize the multiple figures returned by
        the explainer. Can be either 'grid' for a regular plot in a grid format displaying all plots at once,
         or 'carousel' for a carousel that shows one figure at a time with navigation buttons.
        :param beautify: MetaInsight and Fedex explainers. If True, we will attempt to beautify the explanation by having a LLM generate code for producing
        a more visually appealing explanation for this specific case. Defaults to False. Please note that:
        1. This will increase the computation time by a potentially large amount, entirely dependent on the LLM API response time.
        2. The output of the LLM is not guaranteed to be accurate, and may contain errors, so use with caution.
        :param beautify_max_fix_attempts: MetaInsight and Fedex explainers. The maximum number of attempts to fix the
        returned code from the LLM to make it work, if the beautify parameter is set to True. Defaults to 10.
        :param silent_beautify: MetaInsight and Fedex explainers. If True, the beautify process will not print any information
        about its progress, and will only return the final result. Defaults to False.

        :return: A visualization of the explanation, if possible. Otherwise, the raw explanation.
