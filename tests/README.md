A test module for pd-explain using pytest.\
To run the tests, simply run `pytest` in the root directory of the project.\
\
These tests are meant to make sure that pd-explain produces output that is consistent with pandas' output.\
This is done to ensure that pd-explain does not modify the data in any way, and only provides a 
convenient way to get explanations for pandas objects.\
